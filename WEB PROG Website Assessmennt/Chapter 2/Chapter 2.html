        <p style="font-size: 20px;";><b><u>Kel Valdoria ★☆☆☆☆</u></b></p>
        <li><i>Truly something to see all the people giving this remake 5 stars...its somewhat hard to believe they have even watched the movie.  Everything that made the original Mulan great was left out and replaced with what is apparently the last Jedi from the star wars movies.  There little to no character growth, plot is flimsy at best, the plot doesn't actually develop in a fun way (or any way at all; you rely on a witch with no real role but to give causation to special effects to tell you what is going on and what needs to happen next), there are gaping plot holes and the only thing that is "Mulan" about this movie is that they took the premise that a woman dresses up as a man for a few minutes and then decides to save the Emperor of China.  Everything else is completely different and very poorly done.  

            Pros: 
            Graphics
            Some of the acting
            Plot is pretty simple
            
            Cons:
            Plot 
            Characters
            Development
            Storyline
            Universe/Set
            Some of the acting
            Plot is simpler than the original, yet comes out alot more convoluted and harder to follow, though not impossible to follow, just harder (somehow?)
            Graphics placement -  It looks more like the storyline revolves around justifying the use of special effects versus using special effects to actually compliment the story
            
            Overall, its a terrible movie and one of the worst remakes that have made so far.  I like the fact that they tried to make a remake that wasn't a carbon copy clone, but they went far and beyond, many lightyears away into what is effectively a sci-fi B-rated chinese film with great graphics and a Triple A budget.  I would actually recommend a good amount of Chinese films with equivalent themes and direction over this film.  
            
            Ignore those 5 stars from other viewers...a movie should not receive 5 stars because they put sparkles on a screen and bought a great graphics team.  Thats one element of a film, and not even that important of an element in comparison to items like storytelling and character development.

    <li><i>I feel like this was one of Disney's BEST movies to date! Let's not forget that I grew up watching the Cartoon/Animated version of this so I felt there was a LOT to follow up to. 
        In this revised version Not only showed Women Empowerment and Family Devotion but it also showed that if you persevere and believe in yourself that you are capable of anything. 
        This was a truly inspirational movie and one that is great to watch with Young, middle or Older people. This is a timeless movie that is inspiring, thoughtful, action packed, colorful and has amazing characters. 
        Overall, I feel like this is a wonderful movie and one that I will lost definitely buy. 
        I don’t care what the 'critics' say this Movie had amazing Actors, Great Production and the storyline as well as the characters were believable. It was an immersive movie that had me on the edge of my seat in suspense and awe.
        I will be proud to have this on my Movie Shelf, thank you for the Producer, Writer and Actors for bringing this amazing story to life and doing it beautifully.</i></li>

    <li><i>"My ideal woman is courageous."

        Mulan is the live action retelling of the 1998 Disney animated classic.
        The story is relatively similar but a few people have been changed or missing altogether.
        The plot involves a young woman called Mulan, who is gifted with incredible chi and able to achieve physical feats most men cannot.
        When the Chinese army requests that all families send one male member into war against the Rourans,  Mulan's crippled father answers the call.
        Mulan does not wish to see her elderly father risk his life though, so, she instead steals her father's sword and armor and pretends to me a man taking his place.
        Mulan makes many new friends and continues to develop her chi but she also has to keep her distance from others incase they find out her secret...
        It's a very bright and colorful film and there is rarely a slow moment, yet somehow it feels hollow.
        The action on screen didn't illicit much excitement and the story moves at such a brisk pace most of the time it was hard for me to build any emotional attachment to the characters.
        The fighting scenes were well choreographed though and there was some unique sword play but ultimately, I don't think it brought anything new to the table, I've seen similar stunts done better elsewhere.
        It's an innocent, family friendly action adventure and I'm sure the dazzling colors at the very least will impress many!</i></li>
